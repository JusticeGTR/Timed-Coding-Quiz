# Timed Coding Quiz - Homework 4

This is our fourth homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with creating our very own javascript fueled quiz, complete with high score page and timer. High scores are stored in local storage and pulled from there to populate the high scores list.

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

While I've struggled with this one and wish I could have been at more office hours for it, I feel like I've managed to power my way through to a fair degree. It's been slow but I've made somewhat continual progress, getting each feature to work one by one.
